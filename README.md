# Equilibre Finance HTTP API üö≤üí®üï∏Ô∏è

Equilibre Finance HTTP API is used by our app to fetch tokens and liquidity
pool pairs.

Please make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) first.

Next, make a copy of the `env.example` file, and update the relevant variables.

Finally, to start the services run:

    docker compose up

This will start three services:
- `api`: the backend
- `sync`: the service that is constantly syncing information on pairs from the chain
- A redis instance

## Running locally
This project is set up with [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and Python 3.9.14. We recommend installing
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to easily manage different Python versions.

**Note**: Make sure you update your `.env` file to point to localhost (i.e: redis url)

Installing dependencies:

    poetry install

Running the API (after the previous command)

    api-start

Running the syncing process (needed for scraping data from the chain)

    api-sync

This will spawn and use a virtual environment in `.venv` and install the dependencies defined in `poetry.lock`
(or `pyproject.toml`) if the lock file was missing (which should not happen).

When adding new dependencies, one should run:

    poetry add package@version

### **Price Strategy Overview**

The price strategy is designed to fetch the most accurate and reliable token prices by utilizing a combination of internal and external sources. It works by sequentially evaluating these sources based on a predefined order until a valid price is found.

#### **How the Strategy Works:**

This strategy ensures the reliability and accuracy of token prices by systematically evaluating multiple sources and allowing for flexible configuration of source order and token inclusion.

1. **Determine Source Order:**
   - The strategy first determines whether to prioritize internal or external sources based on the `GET_PRICE_INTERNAL_FIRST` configuration.
   - If `True`, it will first attempt to fetch prices from internal sources before moving to external ones, and vice versa.

2. **Fetch Prices:**
   - The strategy iterates over the sources in the determined order.
   - It attempts to fetch the price from each source until a valid price is obtained.
   - If a source fails to provide a valid price, the strategy moves to the next one in the sequence.

3. **Update and Finalize:**
   - Once a valid price is found, the strategy updates the token‚Äôs price and finalizes the update.
   - If no valid price is found after evaluating all sources, the token‚Äôs price remains unchanged.

#### **Configuration Options:**
- **`GET_PRICE_INTERNAL_FIRST`:**
   - Determines the initial source type to be considered.
   - Configurable to either `True` or `False`.

- **`INTERNAL_PRICE_ORDER` and `EXTERNAL_PRICE_ORDER`:**
   - Define the sequence in which the respective internal and external sources are evaluated.
   - Can be customized to prioritize specific sources based on reliability and speed.

- **`IGNORED_TOKEN_ADDRESSES`:**
   - Lists the addresses of tokens to be excluded during price fetching.
   - Useful for omitting unreliable or irrelevant tokens.


### **Cache Strategy Overview**

Our application employs a caching mechanism to optimize performance by reducing frequent data fetches. This brief overview explains the caching strategy and its configurable parameters. This caching strategy ensures efficient data access and a seamless user experience.

#### **Synchronization Mechanism**

The application periodically syncs data points like tokens, pairs, and VARA prices. During synchronization:

1. **Tokens**: Checks cache validity (`assets:json`). If expired, fetches and updates the token list.
2. **Pairs**: Checks cache validity (`pairs:json`). If expired, fetches and updates the pairs data using potential multi-threading.
3. **VARA Price**: Checks cache validity (`vara:json`). If expired, fetches and updates the VARA price.
4. **Circulating Supply**: Verifies cache validity (supply:string). If the cache is outdated, it fetches and updates the circulating supply.
5. **Configuration**: Verifies cache validity (volume:json). If the cache is outdated, it fetches and updates the configuration, ensuring the dexscreener data isn't calculated in every call.

The `sync` function orchestrates the synchronization, while `sync_forever` ensures continuous synchronization at intervals set by `SYNC_WAIT_SECONDS`.

#### **Configurable Cache Expiration**

Cache expiration times determine data validity duration in the cache. These can be set via:

- **TOKEN_CACHE_EXPIRATION**: Token data validity (default: 120 seconds).
- **PAIR_CACHE_EXPIRATION**: Pairs data validity (default: 1 hour).
- **VARA_CACHE_EXPIRATION**: VARA price validity (default: 1 hour).
- **SUPPLY_CACHE_EXPIRATION**: Circulating supply validity (default: 1 hour).

Adjust these configurations in the `.env` file to balance between data freshness and performance.
